## About Laravel-Base

Laravel-Base is an application made with Laravel 10, with the aim of speeding up and facilitating the creation of ACL (User Access Control) in new projects.

Allowing you to save time and start developing the specific functionalities of your application.

## Usage

### Creating new Permissions

In the PermissionSeeder.php file you can see the permissions set by default. The permissions are distributed in groups, groups that will set up the structure to display the permissions when editing a role.

```
$logs = Group::firstOrCreate([
            'name' => 'Log'
]);

Permission::firstOrCreate([ //13
    'group_id' => $logs->id,
    'name' => 'log-view',
    'display_name' => 'Visualizar Log'
]);
```

Above we have an example of creating a group with a permission that belongs to this group. If necessary, you can create another group and enter the 'parent_id' field of the Model **Group**, making it become a subgroup.

```
$admins = Group::firstOrCreate([
    'name' => 'Admin'
]);

$adminPanel = Group::firstOrCreate([
    'name' => 'Admin Panel',
    'parent_id' => $admins->id
]);

Permission::firstOrCreate([ //15
    'group_id' => $adminPanel->id,
    'name' => 'admin-panel',
    'display_name' => 'Panel Admin'
]);
```
Now the 'Admin Panel' group is a subgroup of the 'Admin' group.

### Creating new Roles

In the RoleSeeder.php file you can see the default roles already created and the moment at which they are synchronized (**Many to Many Relationship**). Just add or edit roles and synchronize with the permissions you want.

```
$superAdminRole = Role::firstOrCreate(['id' => 1, 'name' => 'Super Admin']);
$adminRole = Role::firstOrCreate(['id' => 2, 'name' => 'Admin']);
$employeeRole = Role::firstOrCreate(['id' => 3, 'name' => 'FuncionÃ¡rio']);

$allPermissions = Permission::all()->pluck('id');

$superAdminRole->permissions()->sync($allPermissions);
$adminRole->permissions()->sync([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,15]);
```
If you wish, you can not synchronize the permissions at this time and just add them later in the Admin panel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the UserSeeder.php file you will find the system's 'Super Admin' user to start using, but if you prefer you can just register a new user. (_New users are registered with the 'Admin'_ profile).
